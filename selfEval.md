# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

Well... I still fell I am struggling in this area. To me, my understanding of the topic at hand seems to be my biggest downfall. But aside from that. When I google a topic, tend to have a hard time making sense of what I am actually looking for. The "4 w's" Is still a practice I need to work on adopting.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function is a tool that I can use more than once to change differnt target values.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

Arguments are the values that are being submitted into the function.
Parameters the placeholders within the function that depict what happens with the arguments.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

The existance of variables inside of functions, how they work and how are they useful? would be a nice topic to refresh upo.
